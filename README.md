# Go Learning Notes

This repo documents my personal journey learning Go.  
Each numbered directory contains a small, self-contained program along with a `README.md` that explains the concept as if a mentor is walking through it with me.

As I continue learning, I’ll keep adding more lessons — check the folders directly for what’s currently available.

## 🧪 How to run an example

From any lesson directory:

```bash
cd <section>
go run .
```
